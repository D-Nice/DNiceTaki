"F) PMC Rules",
"
PMC (Private Military Contractor) - Generally work for the government performing operations that the government does not have the time, want, or need to fulfill. They can be hired out to the highest bidder to perform what are known as contracts. PMCs can choose whether or not they accept a contract.<br/>

1. Implied Contracts - Implied contracts refer to contracts that a PMC does not necessarily have to meet with a client in order to perform. They are usually low key jobs based around bounty hunting and civil protection. PMC are allowed to work as bounty hunters around the clock. They may detain wanted criminals and turn them into the police at any time. They are also allowed to escort government convoys to the respective bases and operate as general protection authorities (Peacekeepers).<br/>

2. Military Contracting - PMC are allowed to work with , for , or against the Opfor or Blufor, but before doing so they must announce the contract over global! It is at the PMCs discretion which one they choose.<br/>

3. Contracts and Contracting - PMC do not act as hitman, they are not allowed to target one person unless with a really good reason, for instance the Blufor Chief placing a Capture or Kill bounty on the Opfor Commanders head during war time. They may not accept contracts such as 'Kill all Cops' or 'Kill all Insurgents.' They may however take contracts such as clearing a checkpoint in order for an Illegal Weapon / Drug Shipment to get through. A list of acceptable contracts are as follows, use it as a general guideline.<br/>

Escort - Protecting Convoys etc.<br/>
Capture - Capturing and delivering a target to a client.<br/>
Kill - (High Value Targets Only) PMCs may be hired by blufor or opfor to kill the opposing commander or capture an opposing team member.<br/>
Sector Control - PMC may occupy areas and prevent one faction or group from entering it. They may setup a checkpoint, or use force.<br/>
Checkpoint Assistance - PMCs may help man a checkpoint with blufor. In that case they may be treated as a police officer.<br/>
Intelligence - PMC may be hired to gather intelligence on opposing forces or factions.<br/>
Bounty Hunters - They may act as a bounty hunter and may turn in criminals for rewards.<br/>
This is by no means a complete list. If you are questionable on whether a contract is allowed, ask an admin, specifically D-Nice.<br/><br/>

	
4. PMCs are not above the law, They must get consent from a police authority to commit crimes prior to the event occurring unless the crime is committed in self defense. Police are NOT required to clear a PMCs warrants! <br/>

5. PMCs may not use equipment outside of PMC. They may not sell gear or vehicles. PMC is not your personal armory, do NOT use it as such.<br/>

6. PMCs by default are working with Blufor as bounty hunters , and they help them keep the peace. PMCs are KOS for indeps. <br/>

7. Admin Consent is not needed to play PMC, but is advisable.<br/>

8. You must notify the server prior to becoming PMC.<br/>

9. PMC killed on contracts may not ask for comp, unless something outside the contract that is breaking rules results in their death or loss of capital.<br/>

10. If a mod or admin tells you that you may not do something or tells you to switch you must do so otherwise your PMC will be removed! NO QUESTIONS ASKED!<br/>

11. PMCs rarely if ever take on contracts for free. PMCs may set their own contract prices.<br/>

12. PMC is meant to be a dynamic job in which you may roleplay situations out as you see fit as long as they are within reason. If you have any questions contact a mod or admin.<br/>

13. PMCs must obey the New Life Rule. Once they die they are return to normal PMC status.<br/>

14. If PMC are asked who placed the contract or ask what a contract is about, they are not required to tell that person info regarding it until they complete the contract , however if staff ask, they must. After completing a contract resulting in a death of a person and that persons inquires about the reason they are killed, the PMC are required to tell them, but must remind that person they fall under the New Life Rule.<br/>

15. Receiving Contracts - PMCs may discuss contracts with clients in the PMC contracting channel only! They may also meet in game and use in game chats / cell phones in order to communicate. Meeting in game is preferable over using teamspeak, but is not required.<br/>
